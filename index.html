        <p class="texto texto__nome">Hi Zoe,</p>

        <p class="texto">
            Writing is something i’ve always put off as it doesn’t come 
            natural to myself. The reality is the best way to get better 
            at writing is by practising. So let’s do this.
        </p>

        <p class="texto">
            After meddling in Figma for months i’ve finally put together a 
            few template i’ll be using. I’ve made the templates and code 
            open source so you can grab them too.
        </p>

        <p class="texto">
            The last month i’ve been off social media and focusing my attention 
            on Ramadan and taking a break. When you watch videos about growing 
            audiences on social media they talk about consistency.
        </p>

        <p class="texto">
            The reality is how can you be consistent if you don’t have the same 
            energy as you first did? In the UK, “normality” is getting very close, 
            priorities and focuses naturally change.
        </p>

        <p class="texto">
            That’s why it’s okay to take a break and step back and think about why 
            you started in the first place and get that spark back. Something that 
            isn’t talked about enough in the tech world.

            The Intercom podcasts are great especially the series around “Intercom on Product”. 
            This episode focuses on the value of having principles when developing a product and 
            making decisions. It puts all stakeholders on the same page aligning with the same vision. 
            Key when making decisions.
        </p>

        <p class="texto texto__secundario">
            Des and Paul touch on Intercoms principles around “Following fundamentals”, the value of 
            using existing design patterns, instead of reinventing the wheel. As innovation at Intercom 
            is happening at the product level rather than the UI level. Conversely look at Tinder and 
            Snapchat who innovated at the UI level and have made famous design patterns, with swiping 
            cards and stories.
